Binary Trees in C
Introduction
Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to organize and manipulate data in a hierarchical manner. This repository contains a collection of binary tree implementations in C, including basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Features
Basic Operations: Insertion, deletion, and traversal of binary trees.
Tree Traversals: Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.
Tree Height and Size: Calculate the height and size of a binary tree.
Tree Balance: Check if a binary tree is balanced.
Tree Perfectness: Check if a binary tree is perfect.
Tree Completeness: Check if a binary tree is complete.
